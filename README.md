# New Terminal - RS-232 - Serial Port

- Date: ~2002
- Platform: Tested on Windows 95/98/NT

This program can be used to connect to any device over the serial port (rs-232).
It includes the ability to visualise both the HEXA and ASCII code received at the same time. Very useful for debugging.
You can also program a set of input-output commands for any package. By doing so you can simulate any RS-232 device 
protocol.
